        <p id="paragraph"><b>I am Yosef Abate</b>, I was born and raised in Addis Ababa, I have older brother Leulseged who abate works at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWydH0z8I8UIMDr4UBnhVfw">Zemach entertainment</a>. My father is Abate Kebede he works at Ministrey of finance. My mother is Meseret Tesfaye she works at Moha soft drinks factory. <br></br>
            I have learnt in many different schools The first one is Elbethel primary school where I attended from nursery up to grade 1, and then left and joined at Beltower school (formerly known as K.A.S) for a single year. And then to another school where I feel like home, Kebena Adventist School.<br></br> I have learnt there for about 7 years, starting from grade 3 up to grade 10. That is where I have made the friends that I believe I am going to have for life. Like Tadele dessie, Theodros Baye, Teshome Shiferaw, Nathnael Yohannis and many more.  And then I entered Ledeta Cathedral School to learn Grade 11. And Left for another school known by  Selam Children’s village. Where I took my entrance exam to inter into Addis Ababa University, where I am attending right now.I am learning common course at the moment but I plan on learning architecture for the next few years and becoming one.

            I love drawing. I had interest in it since I was a kid. But during most of my teen years I gradually lost interest, but during my final years of teenage I started to enjoy it even more, I started to invest more  time on it and started to commit to a logic of at least 3 drawing per year. Now I have a collection of many drawings. 
            <br></br>My father tried to support my drawing talent and interest. He even registered me to a drawing school named Abissinia. I attended about 3 classes, and then withdrew since I didn’t enjoy the way they taught. I Pretended I was going so that my father won’t be disappointed. So I am mostly self-taught, I watch Youtube videos and other people drawings to improve my skills.
